  abstract = "The visual system is challenged with extracting and representing
              behaviorally relevant information contained in natural inputs of
              great complexity and detail. This task begins in the sensory
              periphery: retinal receptive fields and circuits are matched to
              the first and second-order statistical structure of natural
              inputs. This matching enables the retina to remove stimulus
              components that are predictable (and therefore uninformative),
              and primarily transmit what is unpredictable (and therefore
              informative). Here we show that this design principle applies to
              more complex aspects of natural scenes, and to central visual
              processing. We do this by classifying high-order statistics of
              natural scenes according to whether they are uninformative vs.
              informative. We find that the uninformative ones are perceptually
              nonsalient, while the informative ones are highly salient, and
              correspond to previously identified perceptual mechanisms whose
              neural basis is likely central. Our results suggest that the
              principle of efficient coding not only accounts for filtering
              operations in the sensory periphery, but also shapes subsequent
              stages of sensory processing that are sensitive to high-order

              the tissue level--how neurons of different function distribute
              across its depth and surface on a scale of millimetres. But
              explanations for its design--why it is just so--need to be
              addressed at the synaptic level, a much finer scale where the
              basic description is still lacking. Functional architecture of
              the retina is known from the scale of millimetres down to
              nanometres, so we have sought explanations for various aspects of
              its design. Here we review several aspects of the retina's
              functional architecture and find that all seem governed by a
              single principle: represent the most information for the least
              cost in space and energy. Specifically: (i) why are OFF ganglion
              cells more numerous than ON cells? Because natural scenes contain
              more negative than positive contrasts, and the retina matches its
              neural resources to represent them equally well; (ii) why do
              ganglion cells of a given type overlap their dendrites to achieve
              3-fold coverage? Because this maximizes total information
              represented by the array--balancing signal-to-noise improvement
              against increased redundancy; (iii) why do ganglion cells form
              multiple arrays? Because this allows most information to be sent
              at lower rates, decreasing the space and energy costs for sending
              a given amount of information. This broad principle, operating at

  abstract = "The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by

              fashion. This opponency is thought to reduce redundant
              information by decorrelating the photoreceptor signals.
              Correlations in the receptor signals are caused by the
              substantial overlap of the spectral sensitivities of the
              receptors, but it is not clear to what extent the properties of
              natural spectra contribute to the correlations. To investigate
              the influences of natural spectra and photoreceptor spectral
              sensitivities, we attempted to find linear codes with minimal
              redundancy for trichromatic images assuming human cone spectral
              sensitivities, or hypothetical non-overlapping cone
              sensitivities, respectively. The resulting properties of basis

              show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance
              edges) and along chromatic directions, and they achieve a highly
              efficient encoding of natural chromatic signals. Thus, color
              opponency arises for the encoding of human cone signals, i.e.
              with strongly overlapping spectral sensitivities, but also under
              the assumption of non-overlapping spectral sensitivities. Our

  author   = "Dan, Y and Atick, J J and Reid, R C",
  abstract = "A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in
              the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to
              recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich,
              1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the
              representation of visual information at the level of the
              photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high
              degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It
              was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should
              recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently,
              into a signal with a ``white'' spatial and temporal power
              spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction
              that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporarily
              whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of
              individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying
              images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli.
              Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural
              inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra
              of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the
              power of the responses had an average variation of only
              +/-10.3\%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex
              are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of
              X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their
              responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that
              whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the
              linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our
              results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for
              efficient coding of information in the natural visual
              environment, in agreement with the prediction of the
              computational theory.",

              Victor (1978; Biological Cybernetics, 31, 137-140). Textures
              generated by some recursion rules elicited a visually salient
              percept of structure, while textures generated by other recursion
              rules did not. Textures whose statistical structure was visually

              response evoked by completely random textures. The size of this

              Since the textures were constructed to have identical global

  abstract = "Interneurons exhibiting centre--surround antagonism within their
              receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual
              pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual
              system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the
              deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial
              correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic
              surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring
              receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at
              the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual
              centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted
              by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the
              interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of
              intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against
              intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This
              predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy,
              thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger
              number of distinguishable images, taking into account the
              expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the
              required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation
              theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise
              ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation.
              The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the
              theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show
              that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more
              diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally
              demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly's
              compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to
              account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These
              comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the
              visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image
              to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with
              reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it.
              The treatment emphasizes that a neuron's dynamic range should be
              matched to both its receptive field and the statistical
              properties of the visual pattern expected within this field.
              Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of
              the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow \& Levick 1976),
              satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b)

              compression and data selection",
  author   = "Zhaoping, Li",
  abstract = "Early vision is best understood in terms of two key information
              bottlenecks along the visual pathway -- the optic nerve and, more
              severely, attention. Two effective strategies for sampling and
              representing visual inputs in the light of the bottlenecks are
              (1) data compression with minimum information loss and (2) data
              deletion. This paper reviews two lines of theoretical work which
              understand processes in retina and primary visual cortex (V1) in
              this framework. The first is an efficient coding principle which
              argues that early visual processes compress input into a more
              efficient form to transmit as much information as possible
              through channels of limited capacity. It can explain the
              properties of visual sampling and the nature of the receptive
              fields of retina and V1. It has also been argued to reveal the
              independent causes of the inputs. The second theoretical tack is
              the hypothesis that neural activities in V1 represent the bottom
              up saliencies of visual inputs, such that information can be
              selected for, or discarded from, detailed or attentive
              processing. This theory links V1 physiology with pre-attentive
              visual selection behavior. By making experimentally testable
              predictions, the potentials and limitations of both sets of
              theories can be explored.",

              sensitivity to each of these kinds of statistics have been
              well-studied, much less is known about visual processing when
              multiple kinds of statistics are relevant, in large part because
              the dimensionality of the problem is high and different kinds of
              statistics interact. To approach this problem, we focused on
              binary images on a square lattice - a reduced set of stimuli
              which nevertheless taps many kinds of local statistics. In this
              10-parameter space, we determined psychophysical thresholds to
              each kind of statistic (16 observers) and all of their pairwise
              combinations (4 observers). Sensitivities and isodiscrimination
              contours were consistent across observers. Isodiscrimination
              contours were elliptical, implying a quadratic interaction rule,
              which in turn determined ellipsoidal isodiscrimination surfaces
              in the full 10-dimensional space, and made predictions for
              sensitivities to complex combinations of statistics. These
              predictions, including the prediction of a combination of
              statistics that was metameric to random, were verified
              experimentally. Finally, check size had only a mild effect on
              sensitivities over the range from 2.8 to 14min, but sensitivities
              to second- and higher-order statistics was substantially lower at
              1.4min. In sum, local image statistics form a perceptual space
              that is highly stereotyped across observers, in which different

              that natural signal components with a predictably wider range

              involved in motion perception in mice. We developed a head-fixed
              discrimination task in which mice must report their perceived
              direction of motion from random dot kinematograms (RDKs). After
              training, mice made around 90\% correct choices for stimuli with
              high coherence and performed significantly above chance for 16\%
              coherent RDKs. Accuracy increased with both stimulus duration and
              visual field coverage of the stimulus, suggesting that mice in
              this task integrate motion information in time and space. Retinal
              recordings showed that thalamically projecting On-Off DS ganglion
              cells display DS responses when stimulated with RDKs. Two-photon
              calcium imaging revealed that neurons in layer (L) 2/3 of V1

              engage motion-sensitive retinal circuits as well as downstream
              visual cortical areas. Contralateral V1 activity played a key
              role in this motion direction discrimination task because its
              reversible inactivation with muscimol led to a significant
              reduction in performance. Neurometric-psychometric comparisons

  abstract  = "Rodent visual cortex has a hierarchical architecture similar to
               that of higher mammals (Coogan and Burkhalter, 1993; Marshel et
               al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). Although notable differences
               exist between the species in terms or receptive field sizes and
               orientation map organization (Dr{\"a}ger, 1975; Gattass et al.,
               1987; Van den Bergh et al., 2010), mouse V1 is thought to
               respond to local orientation and visual motion elements rather
               than to global patterns of motion, similar to V1 in higher
               mammals (Niell and Stryker, 2008; Bonin et al., 2011). However,
               recent results are inconclusive: some argue mouse V1 is
               analogous to monkey V1 (Juavinett and Callaway, 2015); others
               argue that it displays complex motion responses (Muir et al.,
               2015). We used type I plaids formed by the additive
               superposition of moving gratings (Adelson and Movshon, 1982;
               Movshon et al., 1985; Albright and Stoner, 1995) to investigate
               this question. We show that mouse V1 contains a considerably
               smaller fraction of component-motion-selective neurons (∼17\% vs
               ∼84\%), and a larger fraction of pattern-motion-selective
               neurons (∼10\% vs <1.3\%) compared with primate/cat V1. The
               direction of optokinetic nystagmus correlates with visual
               perception in higher mammals (Fox et al., 1975; Logothetis and
               Schall, 1990; Wei and Sun, 1998; Watanabe, 1999; Naber et al.,
               2011). Measurement of optokinetic responses to plaid stimuli
               revealed that mice demonstrate bistable perception, sometimes
               tracking individual stimulus components and others the global
               pattern of motion. Moreover, bistable optokinetic responses
               cannot be entirely attributed to subcortical circuitry as V1
               lesions alter the fraction of responses occurring along pattern
               versus component motion. These observations suggest that area V1
               input contributes to complex motion perception in the mouse.
               SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Area V1 in the mouse is hierarchically
               similar but not necessarily identical to area V1 in cats and
               primates. Here we demonstrate that area V1 neurons process
               complex motion plaid stimuli differently in mice versus in cats
               or primates. Specifically, a smaller proportion of mouse V1
               cells are sensitive to component motion, and a larger proportion
               to pattern motion than are found in area V1 of cats/primates.
               Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that mice exhibit
               bistable visual perception of plaid stimuli, and that this
               depends, at least in part, on area V1 input. Finally, we suggest
               that the relative proportion of component-motion-selective
               responses to pattern-motion-selective responses in mouse V1 may
               bias visual perception, as evidenced by changes in the direction
               of elicited optokinetic responses.",

              the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between
              areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1)
              a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision
              and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for
              storing and representing large amounts of information on
              connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to
              the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex.
              Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25
              neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in
              function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as
              visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual
              inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and
              visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\%
              of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected
              with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to
              be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve
              reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive
              connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper,
              including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical,
              transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and
              frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62
              identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an
              overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns
              of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual
              areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive
              than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version
              of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical
              processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the
              retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as
              the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this
              hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams,
              which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental
              organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related
              to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and
              parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and
              relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not
              fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or
              another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these
              represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than
              inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.",

               from the projection strengths in 39 cortical targets, the
               community structure of the network. We found a high density of
               the cortical graph that exceeded that shown previously in
               monkey. Each source area showed a unique distribution of
               projection weights across its targets (i.e., connectivity
               profile) that was well fit by a lognormal function. Importantly,
               the community structure was strongly dependent on the location
               of the source area: outputs from medial/anterior extrastriate
               areas were more strongly linked to parietal, motor, and limbic
               cortices, whereas lateral extrastriate areas were preferentially
               connected to temporal and parahippocampal cortices. These two

  abstract = "It is controversial whether mouse extrastriate cortex has a
              ``simple'' organization in which lateral primary visual cortex
              (V1) is adjoined by a single area V2 or has a ``complex''
              organization, in which lateral V1 is adjoined by multiple
              distinct areas, all of which share the vertical meridian with V1.
              Resolving this issue is important for understanding the evolution
              and development of cortical arealization. We have used triple
              pathway tracing combined with receptive field recordings to map
              azimuth and elevation in the same brain and have referenced these
              maps against callosal landmarks. We found that V1 projects to 15
              cortical fields. At least nine of these contain maps with
              complete and orderly representations of the entire visual
              hemifield and therefore represent distinct areas. One of these,
              PM, adjoins V1 at the medial border. Five areas, P, LM, AL, RL,
              and A, adjoin V1 on the lateral border, but only LM shares the
              vertical meridian representation with V1. This suggests that LM
              is homologous to V2 and that the lateral extrastriate areas do
              not represent modules within a single area V2. Thus, mouse visual
              cortex is ``simple'' in the sense that lateral V1 is adjoined by
              a single V2-like area, LM, and ``complex'' in having a string of
              areas in lateral extrastriate cortex, which receive direct V1
              input. The results suggest that large numbers of areas with
              topologically equivalent maps of the visual field emerge early in
              evolution and that homologous areas are inherited in different

  abstract = "From an ecological point of view, it is generally suggested that
              the main goal of vision in rats and mice is navigation and
              (aerial) predator evasion [1-3]. The latter requires fast and
              accurate detection of a change in the visual environment. An
              outstanding question is whether there are mechanisms in the
              rodent visual system that would support and facilitate visual
              change detection. An experimental protocol frequently used to
              investigate change detection in humans is the oddball paradigm,
              in which a rare, unexpected stimulus is presented in a train of
              stimulus repetitions [4]. A popular ``predictive coding'' theory
              of cortical responses states that neural responses should
              decrease for expected sensory input and increase for unexpected
              input [5, 6]. Despite evidence for response suppression and
              enhancement in noninvasive scalp recordings in humans with this
              paradigm [7, 8], it has proven challenging to observe both
              phenomena in invasive action potential recordings in other
              animals [9-11]. During a visual oddball experiment, we recorded
              multi-unit spiking activity in rat primary visual cortex (V1) and

              and not for response enhancement. However, higher up in area LI,
              spiking activity showed clear surprise-based response enhancement
              in addition to stimulus-specific adaptation. These results show
              that neural responses along the rat ventral visual stream become
              increasingly sensitive to changes in the visual environment,

               evidence from behavioral studies that show rats can be trained

  abstract = "In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located
              laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a
              putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate
              ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we
              found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al.,
              2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized
              for coding object identity despite view changes, the hallmark
              property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify
              what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this
              aim, we performed multielectrode recordings from V1 and
              laterolateral area LL (at the apex of the putative ventral-like
              hierarchy) of male adult rats, during the presentation of
              drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to
              which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the
              gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of
              the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation.
              Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different
              oriented gratings increased, whereas the sharpness of orientation
              tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the
              nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take
              place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of
              hierarchical models of ventral computations and a meta-analysis
              of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology
              between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape
              selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of
              primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as
              models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry
              level.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite the growing popularity of
              rodents as models of visual functions, it remains unclear whether
              their visual cortex contains specialized modules for processing
              shape information. To addresses this question, we compared how
              neuronal tuning evolves from rat primary visual cortex (V1) to a
              downstream visual cortical region (area LL) that previous work
              has implicated in shape processing. In our experiments, LL
              neurons displayed a stronger tendency to respond to drifting
              gratings with different orientations while maintaining a
              sustained response across the whole duration of the drift cycle.
              These trends match the increased complexity of pattern
              selectivity and the augmented tolerance to stimulus translation
              found in monkey visual temporal cortex, thus revealing a homology
              between shape processing in rodents and primates.",

               different images. We found that both V4 and IT encode natural

               more sensitive to controlled, statistical scrambling of those
               images. Scrambling sensitivity was proportional to receptive

               the number of visual feature conjunctions implemented by a V4 or

              Allodynia was induced by administering 35\% v/v ethanol (10 g/kg;
              oral gavage) to Spraue-Dawley rats for 8 weeks. Rolipram and
              saline (vehicle) were administered intraperitoneally. Mechanical

              ethanol-induced mechanical allodynia began to manifest from 3
              week, and then peaked within 1 week. Beginning from 3 week,
              latency significantly started to increased in control group. In

              degree this functional organization is related to the well-known
              hierarchical organization of the visual system in primates. We
              designed a study in rats that targets one of the hallmarks of the
              hierarchical object vision pathway in primates: selectivity for
              behaviorally relevant dimensions. We compared behavioral
              performance in a visual water maze with neural discriminability
              in five visual cortical areas. We tested behavioral
              discrimination in two independent batches of six rats using six
              pairs of shapes used previously to probe shape selectivity in
              monkey cortex (Lehky and Sereno, 2007). The relative difficulty
              (error rate) of shape pairs was strongly correlated between the
              two batches, indicating that some shape pairs were more difficult
              to discriminate than others. Then, we recorded in naive rats from
              five visual areas from primary visual cortex (V1) over areas LM,
              LI, LL, up to lateral occipito-temporal cortex (TO). Shape
              selectivity in the upper layers of V1, where the information
              enters cortex, correlated mostly with physical stimulus
              dissimilarity and not with behavioral performance. In contrast,
              neural discriminability in lower layers of all areas was strongly
              correlated with behavioral performance. These findings, in
              combination with the results from Vermaercke et al. (2014b),

              animal by presenting gratings of different orientations, spatial
              and temporal frequencies, dimensions, and contrasts. Stimulus
              presentation and data collection were automated. Most neurons
              (190/205) showed sharply tuned (</=30 degrees bandwidth at half
              height) orientation selectivity with a bias for horizontal
              stimuli (31\%). Analysis of response modulation of oriented cells
              showed a bimodal distribution consistent with the distinction
              between simple and complex cell types. Orientation specific
              interactions occurred between the center and the periphery of
              receptive fields, usually resulting in strong inhibition to
              center stimulation when both stimuli had the same orientation.
              There was no evidence for orientation columns nor for orderly
              change in optimal orientation with tangential tracks through V1.
              Responses were elicited by spatial frequencies ranging from zero
              (no grating) to 1.2 cycle/degree (c/ degrees ), peaking at 0.1 c/
              degrees, and with a modal cutoff of 0.6 c/ degrees. Half of the
              neurons responded optimally to drifting gratings rather than
              flashing uniform field stimuli. Directional preference was seen
              for 59\% of oriented units at all depths in the cortex. Optimal
              stimuli velocities varied from 10 to 250 degrees /s. Some units,
              mainly confined to layer 4, responded to velocities as high as
              700 degrees /s. Response versus contrast curves (best fit with
              Naka-Rushton) varied from nearly linear to extremely steep (mean
              contrast semisaturation 50\% and threshold 6\%). There was a
              trend for cells from superficial layers to be more selective to
              different stimulus parameters than deeper layers cells. We
              conclude that neurons in rat V1 have complex and diverse visual

              the thalamic and cortical circuits underlying visual perception.
              Given that visually guided behavior in the absence of primary
              visual cortex has been described in the literature, however, it
              is an empirical question whether specific visual behaviors will
              depend on primary visual cortex in the rat. Here we tested the
              effects of cortical lesions on performance of two-alternative
              forced-choice visual discriminations by Long-Evans rats. We
              present data from one highly informative subject that learned
              several visual tasks and then received a bilateral lesion

              of anatomical and physiological studies in primates and
              carnivores have revealed a complex parallel and hierarchical
              organization by which distinct visual features are distributed

              studies have been limited in their ability to dissect the circuit

  abstract = "In recent years, a number of studies have explored the possible
              use of rats as models of high-level visual functions. One central
              question at the root of such an investigation is to understand
              whether rat object vision relies on the processing of visual
              shape features or, rather, on lower-order image properties (e.g.,
              overall brightness). In a recent study, we have shown that rats
              are capable of extracting multiple features of an object that are
              diagnostic of its identity, at least when those features are,
              structure-wise, distinct enough to be parsed by the rat visual
              system. In the present study, we have assessed the impact of
              object structure on rat perceptual strategy. We trained rats to
              discriminate between two structurally similar objects, and
              compared their recognition strategies with those reported in our
              previous study. We found that, under conditions of lower stimulus
              discriminability, rat visual discrimination strategy becomes more
              view-dependent and subject-dependent. Rats were still able to
              recognize the target objects, in a way that was largely tolerant
              (i.e., invariant) to object transformation; however, the larger
              structural and pixel-wise similarity affected the way objects
              were processed. Compared to the findings of our previous study,
              the patterns of diagnostic features were: (i) smaller and more
              scattered; (ii) only partially preserved across object views; and
              (iii) only partially reproducible across rats. On the other hand,
              rats were still found to adopt a multi-featural processing
              strategy and to make use of part of the optimal discriminatory
              information afforded by the two objects. Our findings suggest
              that, as in humans, rat invariant recognition can flexibly rely
              on either view-invariant representations of distinctive object
              features or view-specific object representations, acquired

              it remains unclear whether rodents are capable of deploying
              advanced shape-processing strategies when engaged in visual
              object recognition. In rats, for instance, pattern vision has
              been reported to range from mere detection of overall object
              luminance to view-invariant processing of discriminative shape
              features. Here we sought to clarify how refined object vision is
              in rodents, and how variable the complexity of their visual
              processing strategy is across individuals. To this aim, we
              measured how well rats could discriminate a reference object from
              11 distractors, which spanned a spectrum of image-level
              similarity to the reference. We also presented the animals with
              random variations of the reference, and processed their responses
              to these stimuli to derive subject-specific models of rat
              perceptual choices. Our models successfully captured the highly
              variable discrimination performance observed across subjects and
              object conditions. In particular, they revealed that the animals
              that succeeded with the most challenging distractors were those
              that integrated the wider variety of discriminative features into
              their perceptual strategies. Critically, these strategies were
              largely preserved when the rats were required to discriminate
              outlined and scaled versions of the stimuli, thus showing that
              rat object vision can be characterized as a
              transformation-tolerant, feature-based filtering process.
              Overall, these findings indicate that rats are capable of
              advanced processing of shape information, and point to the

              tremendous variation in their appearance on the retina resulting
              from variation in view, size, lighting, etc. This ability--known
              as ``invariant'' object recognition--is central to visual
              perception, yet its computational underpinnings are poorly
              understood. Traditionally, nonhuman primates have been the animal
              model-of-choice for investigating the neuronal substrates of
              invariant recognition, because their visual systems closely
              mirror our own. Meanwhile, simpler and more accessible animal
              models such as rodents have been largely overlooked as possible
              models of higher-level visual functions, because their brains are
              often assumed to lack advanced visual processing machinery. As a
              result, little is known about rodents' ability to process complex
              visual stimuli in the face of real-world image variation. In the
              present work, we show that rats possess more advanced visual
              abilities than previously appreciated. Specifically, we trained
              pigmented rats to perform a visual task that required them to
              recognize objects despite substantial variation in their
              appearance, due to changes in size, view, and lighting.
              Critically, rats were able to spontaneously generalize to
              previously unseen transformations of learned objects. These
              results provide the first systematic evidence for invariant
              object recognition in rats and argue for an increased focus on

              as high-frequency power in the local field potential) and

              and noise images in V1 and V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys of
              both sexes. As previously reported, recordings in V2 showed
              consistently stronger responses to naturalistic texture than to
              spectrally matched noise. In contrast to single-unit recordings,
              V1 multiunit activity showed a preference for images with
              naturalistic statistics, and in gamma-band activity this
              preference was comparable across V1 and V2. Sensitivity to
              naturalistic image structure was strongest in the supragranular
              and infragranular layers of V1, but weak in granular layers,
              suggesting that it might reflect feedback from V2. Response
              timing was consistent with this idea. Visual responses appeared
              first in V1, followed by V2. Sensitivity to naturalistic texture
              emerged first in V2, followed by the supragranular and
              infragranular layers of V1, and finally in the granular layers of

              of higher-order statistics of natural texture, and suggest that
              this sensitivity first arises in V2 and is fed back to modulate

              responsible for visual representations of intermediate complexity
              are largely unknown. We used a well validated set of synthetic
              texture stimuli to probe the temporal and laminar profile of
              sensitivity to the higher-order statistical structure of natural
              images. We found that this sensitivity emerges first and most
              strongly in V2 but soon after in V1. However, sensitivity in V1
              is higher in the laminae (extragranular) and recording modalities
              (local field potential) most likely affected by V2 connections,
              suggesting a feedback origin. Our results show how sensitivity to

              Recent study suggests that, for processing of textures, a
              collection of higher-order image statistics computed by combining
              V1-like filter responses serves as possible representations of
              textures both in V2 and V4. Here, to gain a clue for how these
              image statistics are processed in the extrastriate visual areas,
              we compared neuronal responses to textures in V2 and V4 of
              macaque monkeys. For individual neurons, we adaptively explored
              their preferred textures from among thousands of naturalistic
              textures and fitted the obtained responses using a combination of
              V1-like filter responses and higher-order statistics. We found
              that, while the selectivity for image statistics was largely
              comparable between V2 and V4, V4 showed slightly stronger
              sensitivity to the higher-order statistics than V2. Consistent
              with that finding, V4 responses were reduced to a greater extent
              than V2 responses when the monkeys were shown spectrally matched

              of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be
              useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural
              environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In
              this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to
              how they represent the information in such natural images. The
              coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of
              mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial
              frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many

              between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order
              redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients).
              Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and
              permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the
