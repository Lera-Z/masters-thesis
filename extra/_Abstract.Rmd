Previous theoretical and experimental research demonstrated that human sensitivity to image statistics â€“ in particular, to correlations between one to four points - follows the variability of these statistics in natural environments. However, the neural basis of such sensitivity ranking in the brain has not been identified yet. It has been proposed that brain selectivity to three- and four-point correlations might be stronger in higher visual areas than in primary visual cortex.

The current work employs the advantages of the rat visual system model to investigate where in the brain such sensitivity to higher-image statistics occurs. Correlations of up to four points were controlled in a set of textures, which are a specific type of stimuli that allows to fix a selected image statistic at a particular level while randomizing all other statistical properties. Six awake anesthetized Long-Evans rats were presented with textures and white noise stimuli, while the activity of two brain areas - V1 (primary visual cortex) and LL (laterolateral area) - was recorded.

Quantitative analysis of multiunits' properties and decoding analysis demonstrated that area V1 is sensitive to one-point correlations and shows a trend towards sensitivity to two-point correlations, but not to three- and four-point ones. Area LL is selective to one-point and four-point correlations and shows a trend towards sensitivity to three-point correlations.

These findings partially confirm our hypothesis regarding V1 and LL sensitivity to multipoint correlations. Further evidence and data analysis modifications, however, are needed to draw more reliable conclusions. Overall, the current findings add to an emerging body of research on visual perception and have implications for both computational models and theories, and practical challenges, such as the creation and enhancement of human-computer interfaces.
